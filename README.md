Here are options that you have in MultiOpener at the moment:

* Creating as many presets as you want and load them to use
* Option to add MultiMC for openning your all minecraft instances for wall
* Posibility to add any program as general control and give delays before and after it opens
* Cancel when openning processes
* Cos tam jeszcze tutaj bedzie napewno

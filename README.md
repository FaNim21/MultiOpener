# MultiOpener

## MultiOpener is a quality of life desktop application designed to assist Minecraft speedrunners and other users in opening multiple programs simultaneously with ease.

MultiOpener is a time-saving solution for users who frequently run multiple programs simultaneously. With this program, you can easily set up all the programs you need and open and close them with ease.
Here are the main features of MultiOpener:

* Create as many presets as you need and load them whenever you want
* MultiOpener includes an option to add MultiMC for opening all your Minecraft instances at once.
* Add any program as a general control and set delays before and after it opens
* If needed, you can cancel the opening processes at any time.
* Control any apps you open using MultiOpener by right-clicking them in the start panel and choosing from options like close, open, reset, or view detailed information


## Quick notes

Please note that when opening MultiOpener, some users may see a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen popup warning them that the app is unrecognized. We would like to assure you that this is not a virus and that MultiOpener is a safe and legitimate application. If you encounter this warning, simply click on 'More info' and then 'Run anyway' to proceed with opening MultiOpener.

MultiOpener is made using .NET C# 7.0, which means that in order to use the application, you will need to download the .NET Desktop Runtime once. It will popup after first open or you can download the required runtime from the official Microsoft website.

Additionally, MultiOpener includes a feature to open and close multiple running applications. Please note that this feature is provided as-is and is to be used at your own risk. MultiOpener does not guarantee compatibility or stability with all running applications, and we are not responsible for any problems that may arise from the use of this feature.

Finally, MultiOpener uses various file manipulation methods, such as the create method, to save your preset configurations. This is a normal and expected behavior of the application. MultiOpener does not access or modify any files outside of its own directory, and it does not collect or transmit any user data or information.


## How to use it?

* To get started with MultiOpener, create your first preset by navigating to the "Presets" button located in the top left corner of the main window.
* On the right side of the Presets menu, you will find a section where you can add programs to open. Enter a name for the program you want to add, and then add it to your preset.
* Next, click on the program you just added, and make sure to set the most important thing, the path to that program.
* You can also set delays for each program to open, and customize the timing as needed.
* If you want to open instances from Minecraft MultiMC Launcher, you will need to set the combo box located in the top left corner to "Instances (MultiMC)".
* Once you have done that, you can set the number of instances you want to open, and customize their names from the folder sides of MultiMC.
* Lastly, If you plan on running multiple instances, I recommend setting a delay between each instance to allow enough time to open Wall and detect all instances. For high-end PCs, a delay of at least 3000 is recommended, while low-end PCs may require a delay of at least 15,000, you'll have to try it yourself..
* Once you have added all the programs and customized the settings as needed, you can name your preset in the bottom right corner and save it to a file by clicking the "Save" button.
* After you've opened your programs in the start panel, you can control them by resetting, closing, or opening them as needed.
